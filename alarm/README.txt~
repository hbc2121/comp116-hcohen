Assignment 2

I have implemented the program to analyze the live network traffic for all of
the specified incidents. The program analyzes each packet for the flags or 
information that would yield a specific scan. The porgram outputs an ALERT 
in the proper way.

Danielle Zelin caught me up on the information that I needed to know in order
to complete the assignment as I had missed class

I worked 5 hours on this assignment

--Qestions--
1. The heuristics seem to be able to determine all incidents but there are 
probably loopholes in my program that would allow incidents "even that good"
to go unnoticed. The program only does simple checks on the flags and does 
not do much more analysis past that
2. In the future I would handle all of the corner cases and do more research
 into how a scan can go unnoticed. I would look into all of the possible ways, not just the basics, to detect a scan, and try to implement those.
